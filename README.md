# Protein‚ÄìLigand Binding Affinity Prediction with Quantum Features

This project implements a deep learning pipeline to predict binding affinities between ligands and proteins using both molecular graph information and quantum mechanical descriptors.

---

## üß™ Dataset

We use the **KIBA** dataset, enriched with quantum mechanical (QM) descriptors from **QMugs** or similar sources.

### Dataset Features

- **SMILES** strings for ligands
- **Amino acid sequences** for proteins
- **KIBA scores** as regression targets
- **Quantum features**:
  - `homo`: HOMO energy
  - `lumo`: LUMO energy
  - `gap`: Computed as `lumo - homo`
  - `dipole_x`, `dipole_y`, `dipole_z`: Dipole vector components
  - `dipole_total`: Dipole moment magnitude

## üß† Model Architecture

This project uses three modules:

### 1. Ligand Encoder (`LigandGCN`)
- Graph Neural Network (GINConv)
- Converts ligand SMILES to molecular graphs
- Output: 135-dimensional embedding

### 2. Protein Encoder (`ProteinCNN`)
- 1D Convolutional Neural Network
- Converts amino acid sequences into embeddings
- Output: 128-dimensional embedding

### 3. Affinity Predictor (`AffinityPredictor`)
- Multilayer perceptron
- Input: `[ligand_vec || QM features || protein_vec]`
- Output: Scalar prediction (binding affinity)

## üîç Hyperparameter Tuning (Optuna)

We tune the following parameters:

- `dropout`: between 0.2 and 0.5
- `hidden_dim`: {128, 256, 512}
- `batch_size`: {32, 64, 128}

## üß¨ Applications

This model and pipeline can be used for:

  Predicting bioactivity scores for protein‚Äìligand pairs using structure and QM-informed descriptors.

- **Quantum-informed virtual screening**  
  Leveraging HOMO‚ÄìLUMO gaps and dipole moments to bias ML models toward chemically plausible ligands.

- **Cheminformatics research**  
  Exploring the effects of electronic structure features on binding affinity, enabling hybrid DFT + ML approaches.

- **Benchmarking ligand embeddings**  
  Testing different graph neural network architectures on chemically relevant regression tasks.

- **Modeling electronic interactions in drug discovery**  
  Going beyond topological fingerprints by including quantum-derived fields such as polarity and orbital energies.
